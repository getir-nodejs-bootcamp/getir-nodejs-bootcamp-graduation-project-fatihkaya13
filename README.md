# Getir Node.js Bootcamp Graduation Project

## Introduction

This guide covers the installation of the case study project 
and gives detailed explanation about API error codes as well as
responses and requests.

## Requirements

- [x] The code should be written in Node.js using express framework.
- [x] The endpoint should just handle HTTP POST requests.
- [x] The application is deployed to AWS.
- [x] Error handling is applied.
- [x] Logging is applied.
- [x] Modular structure is applied.
- [x] Test suites are applied.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
The service is deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The URL is provided below.

- http://fatihkaya-getir-case-study.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

The following route handles post requests.

- http://fatihkaya-getir-case-study.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/records

## AWS ECS Deployment and Docker Documentation
In addition, the application is containerized with docker and being deployed to AWS ECS. 
The url is below, it handles POST request.

- http://api-ecsalb-c48q2s6quzm5-769499631.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/records

This was an optional learning journey for me while working on the following tutorial.

The documentation for building and running docker image locally and deployment process can be found via the following link.

## Step 1 - installation

- Clone the project. 
- folder structure without node_modules folder and .env should like like the below diagram.

```

```
- within the same directory, create an .env file and write environment variables as described in .env-sample file.

``` bash
  touch .env
```
- Then, please install the required dependencies via npm.

``` bash
  npm install
```

## Step 2 - run the project

``` bash
  npm start
```
- The application service will log successful DB connection messages to the console.

``` json
{"level":"info","message":"trying to establish MongoDB connection","service":"express-app-service"}
{"level":"info","message":"Server is running on port 8080... press cntrl-c to exit","service":"express-app-service"}
{"level":"info","message":"connected to MongoDB","service":"express-app-service"}
```

## Step 3 - send POST request

- please send a post request to http://localhost:8080/records route within the provided body below via postman.

```json
{
    "startDate": "2016-01-26", 
    "endDate": "2016-04-02", 
    "minCount": 2900, 
    "maxCount": 2950
}
```
- or simply via curl command as below within single line.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/records 
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
     -d '{"startDate": "2016-01-26", "endDate": "2016-04-02", "minCount": 2900 "maxCount": 2950}'
```
<details><summary> <b>Click to see response</b> </summary>
<p>


```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "Success",
  "records": [
      {
          "key": "rwghjfLQ",
          "createdAt": "2016-03-17T11:07:46.355Z",
          "totalCount": 2907
      },
      {
          "key": "HNUPzQoW",
          "createdAt": "2016-03-17T09:47:23.943Z",
          "totalCount": 2931
      },
      {
          "key": "HNUPzQoW",
          "createdAt": "2016-03-17T09:47:23.943Z",
          "totalCount": 2931
      },
      {
          "key": "UYOsBBSI",
          "createdAt": "2016-02-14T15:31:29.518Z",
          "totalCount": 2948
      }
  ]
}
```

## Error codes

| Response Code | HTTP Status Code | Error Explanation               |
| :---          |     :---         |          :---                   |
| 0             | 200              | Success                         |
| 1             | 404              | Response not found              |
| 3             | 500              | Internal Server Error           |
| 4             | 400              | Validation Error                |
| 5             | 404              | Endpoint is not found           |

## QA Plan

### 1. Test Scripts
- There are seven tests that evaluates for cases such as response codes, error handling mechanism and function results.
- In order too run test suites, please type...
```bash
npm test
```
### 2. eslint and prettier npm modules are installed as developer dependencies.

## Application structure

<img width="930" alt="diagram" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56218812/147465114-0257696a-fd69-47b1-bbe1-0728625151de.png">

the above diagram is prepared via https://miro.com/

- One of the key advantages of handling validation errors via Joi module at route level is to send response as much as quick to the client.
- Therefore; request is not required to go up until the model and database layer which increases response time efficiency.

## Further improvements

- [ ] cookie parser and session middleware might be added.
- [ ] error classes might be differentiated.
- [ ] The application might be deployed to AWS via Code Commit for continuous integration.

## Conclusion

Thanks for visiting my project.
Any feedback is highly welcomed.
